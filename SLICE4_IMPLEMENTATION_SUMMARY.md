## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

### Multi-Agent Implementation Strategy

Used 3 specialized agents to implement different aspects of Slice 4:

1. **Agent 1**: Voice dependencies and API route infrastructure
2. **Agent 2**: Frontend voice hooks and UI components
3. **Agent 3**: Helper APIs and comprehensive testing

### Core Components

#### 1. Voice API Route (`app/(chat)/api/voice/route.ts`)

**HTTP Methods Implemented**:
- `POST`: Initialize voice sessions with authentication and rate limiting
- `GET`: Establish Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream for real-time communication
- `PUT`: Handle voice actions (`speak`, `sendAudio`, `listen`)
- `DELETE`: Clean session disconnect

**Key Features**:
- OpenAI Realtime Voice API integration
- Session management with 30-minute timeout
- Rate limiting (20 messages/day for guests, 100 for users)
- Authentication via NextAuth
- Real-time audio streaming via SSE

#### 2. RoboRail Voice Agent (`lib/ai/agents/roborail-voice-agent.ts`)

**Core Capabilities**:
- **OpenAI Realtime Voice**: Uses `@mastra/voice-openai-realtime`
- **Memory Persistence**: Integrates with PostgresMemory for conversation history
- **RAG Integration**: Uses existing RoboRail knowledge base

- Browser-specific guidance for microphone access
- Auto-permission checking on mount

#### 5. Audio Processing (`lib/audio-utils.ts`)

**AudioPlayer Class**:
- Base64 and URL audio playback
- Audio context management
- Autoplay policy handling
- Resource cleanup

**AudioRecorder Class**:

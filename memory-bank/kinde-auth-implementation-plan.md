# Kinde Auth Implementation Plan
## Research Summary & Strategic Approach

Based on comprehensive research, Kinde Auth offers superior testing infrastructure and CI/CD integration capabilities compared to our current NextAuth.js setup. This plan outlines a gradual migration approach using vertical slices.

### Key Benefits
- **Environment Isolation**: Unlimited non-production environments with separate API keys
- **Enhanced Testing**: Isolated test data and feature flag management
- **Better CI/CD**: Environment-specific configurations and automated testing support
- **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive user management and authentication flows

### Migration Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Parallel implementation (keep NextAuth.js running)
- **Phase 2**: Gradual feature migration
- **Phase 3**: Complete transition and cleanup

# Active Context

## Current Focus

### Development Status
- **Phase**: Kinde Auth implementation planning complete
- **Current Slice**: Ready to begin Slice 1 (Kinde Auth Setup & Configuration)
- **Active Work**: Authentication system enhancement with superior testing infrastructure

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Kinde Auth Migration**: Implement comprehensive authentication upgrade using vertical slice approach
2. **Testing Infrastructure**: Leverage Kinde's environment isolation for enhanced CI/CD testing
3. **System Enhancement**: Improve authentication security and developer experience
4. **Gradual Migration**: Ensure zero-downtime transition from NextAuth.js

## Current Implementation Plan

### Kinde Auth Vertical Slices (4-week timeline)
- **Slice 1**: Kinde Auth Setup & Configuration (Week 1)
- **Slice 2**: User Authentication & Session Management (Week 1) 
- **Slice 3**: Testing Infrastructure & Environment Setup (Week 2)
- **Slice 4**: Advanced Features & User Management (Week 3)
- **Slice 5**: Migration Completion & Cleanup (Week 4)

## Next Steps

### This Week
1. **Review Implementation Plan**: Validate approach with development team
2. **Set Up Kinde Account**: Create test environments and API keys
3. **Begin Slice 1**: Start with basic Kinde configuration alongside existing NextAuth.js

### Risk Mitigation
- **Parallel Systems**: Run Kinde alongside NextAuth.js during transition
- **Environment Isolation**: Use separate Kinde environments for dev/test/staging/prod
- **Gradual Rollout**: Implement user migration in phases with rollback procedures

## Research Findings Applied

### Key Benefits Identified
- **Environment Separation**: Unlimited non-production environments with isolated API keys
- **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive test user management and CI/CD integration
- **Superior Developer Experience**: Feature flags, organizations, and improved documentation
- **ROI Justification**: $25/month investment with significant testing infrastructure improvements

### Memory Bank Updates
- Created comprehensive implementation plan in `memory-bank/kinde-auth-implementation-plan.md`
- Updated technical context to include Kinde Auth migration strategy
- Documented testing enhancement opportunities and CI/CD integration benefits

## Constraints & Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Maintain <500 lines per file limit
- No hardcoded secrets (use environment variables)
- Comprehensive test coverage for all authentication flows
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns

### Migration Strategy
- **Zero Downtime**: Ensure seamless user experience during transition
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive user data migration with validation
- **Rollback Ready**: Maintain ability to revert to NextAuth.js if needed
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Add features incrementally while maintaining stability

## Pending Tasks (No Taskmaster Integration)

### High Priority
- Validate all system components are functioning correctly
- Ensure database connections and migrations are working
- Verify AI provider integrations and model availability
- Test RAG document processing pipeline

### Medium Priority  
- Review and update security configurations
- Optimize performance for production workloads
- Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Update documentation for any recent changes

### Low Priority
- Explore additional AI provider integrations
- Consider UI/UX improvements
- Investigate advanced RAG techniques
- Plan for future feature enhancements

## Recent Context

### Last Known State
- All 5 development slices appear to be complete:
  1. ✅ Basic Project Setup (Next.js, Auth, Database)
  2. ✅ RAG Integration (Document processing, Vector search)
  3. ✅ Multi-Turn Conversations (Memory management)
  4. ✅ Voice Interaction (OpenAI Realtime API)
  5. ✅ Observability & Polish (LangSmith, Production ready)

### Key Accomplishments
- Comprehensive project structure established
- Multi-provider AI integration complete
- RAG system with PostgreSQL + pgvector implemented
- Voice interaction capabilities integrated
- Test infrastructure and CI/CD setup
- Production deployment configuration

## Technical Debt & Considerations

### Code Quality
- Ensure all files adhere to <500 line limit
- Validate no hardcoded secrets exist in codebase
- Review modular architecture adherence
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage

### Infrastructure
- Monitor database connection management
- Optimize vector search performance
- Ensure proper error handling throughout system
- Validate environment configuration completeness

## Notes

### Integration with Taskmaster
- Memory Bank system is now initialized and ready for use
- When Taskmaster is integrated, this file should be updated with:
  - Current Taskmaster task ID
  - Task-specific context and progress
  - Dependencies and blockers
  - Task completion status

### Development Environment
- All development tools and dependencies are configured
- Testing infrastructure is established
- CI/CD pipeline appears to be functional
- Development workflow is documented and ready for team collaboration

# Project Brief: Mastra Chat SDK - RoboRail Assistant

## Project Vision

Build a comprehensive AI-powered chat application that serves as an intelligent assistant for RoboRail technical documentation and operations, leveraging advanced RAG capabilities and multi-modal interactions.

## Primary Goals

### Core Objectives
1. **Intelligent Documentation Assistant**: Provide instant, contextual access to RoboRail technical documentation through advanced RAG capabilities
2. **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Support both text and voice-based interactions for flexible user engagement
3. **Persistent Memory System**: Maintain conversation context across sessions for enhanced user experience
4. **Real-time Collaboration**: Enable real-time updates and progress tracking for document processing

### Technical Goals
1. **Modular Architecture**: Build with clean separation of concerns and extensible design patterns
2. **Multi-Provider AI Support**: Support multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq) for resilience and flexibility
3. **Production-Ready**: Implement comprehensive testing, error handling, and observability
4. **Scalable Infrastructure**: Design for horizontal scaling and high availability

## Success Criteria

### User Experience
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for RAG-enhanced responses
- **Voice Processing**: < 1 second for speech transcription and processing
- **Document Upload**: Real-time progress tracking with seamless processing
- **Context Retention**: Maintain conversation context across multiple sessions

### Technical Excellence
- **Test Coverage**: > 90% code coverage across all components
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability in production
- **Security**: Zero security vulnerabilities in production code
- **Performance**: Support 100+ concurrent users without degradation

## Key Stakeholders
- **End Users**: RoboRail operators and technical staff requiring documentation assistance
- **Technical Team**: Developers maintaining and extending the system
- **Product Owner**: Stakeholder defining feature requirements and priorities

## Constraints & Requirements
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router and React Server Components
- **AI Framework**: Mastra AI for agent orchestration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector storage
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for secure user management
- **Deployment**: Vercel or similar platform for production hosting

## Timeline & Milestones
The project is organized into 5 vertical slices:
1. **Slice 1**: Basic Project Setup (Authentication, Database, Mastra Integration)
2. **Slice 2**: RAG Integration (Document Processing, Vector Search)
3. **Slice 3**: Multi-Turn Conversations (Memory Management, Session Persistence)
4. **Slice 4**: Voice Interaction (OpenAI Realtime API, Speech-to-Speech)
5. **Slice 5**: Observability & Polish (LangSmith, Production Readiness)
